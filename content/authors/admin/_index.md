My core research interest lies in the responses of leaf carbon metabolism and hydraulics to the environmental changes that are imposed by global change. Particularly, I am addressing how high temperature and drought influences CO<sub>2</sub> and water movement inside the leaf, and enzymes involved in the carbon assimilation. The goal of my research is to identify exploitable leaf-level traits in C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants to develop climate-resilient crops. To achieve this goal, my research is melding multidisciplinary approaches such as leaf physiology, biochemistry, and stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen in wild and crop plants.
